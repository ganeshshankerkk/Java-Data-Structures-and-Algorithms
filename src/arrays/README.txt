Arrays - When to use
--------------------------
1. To store multiple variables of same data type
2. Random access (Since accessing given random number from array takes O(1) time complexity, stored in memory contiguously)

Arrays - When not to use
--------------------------
1. Same data type elements (In some programming language)
2. Reserve specific memory (cannot exceed given length, also if certain index is not used, still memory is reserved)
